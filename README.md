Okay so I attempted to build a file upload project expected it to be a rival amongst mediafire or fckitupload but it ended up trash. I used multer and a little bit of bootstrap and PassportJS. It Got boring after while my mind wanted something new. 

  - [Multer](https://github.com/expressjs/multer)
  - Pug- Omg this is a good good template eng find that your own
  - Rest was Magic

# You can:
      - Login
        - Register
        - Upload files
        - View files ( failed part)

You know how you wanna build an app cause just cause you wanna see if you can make a fortune$$$%%. Now I know I can build it but fck the fortune
